    # Read the file with the specified method.
    #
    # Use `cat` to read the file if it is a potential specification of a file
    # in `/dev`, `/proc`, or `/sys` (kernel-created virtual file).
    #
    # `cat` will read the file in one `read` syscall. This is important because
    # certain kernel files can only be read() once, returning EOF on subsequent
    # read() syscalls. This behavior is prevalent for certain files in `/proc`
    # which do not support seeking.
    #
    # `cat` reads a file in large chunks, accommodating the requirement for a
    # single read(). This contrasts with a POSIX shell, which reads files one
    # byte at a time and may only return the first byte of data from certain
    # kernel files.
    #
    # Use the shell to read the file if it is a small (< ~10000XX lines),
    # user-created file. `-subshell` performs better on big files (> ~50000
    # lines), while `-var` performs better on small files.
