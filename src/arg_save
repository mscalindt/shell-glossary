    # The usage of `eval` here is safe. Assuming $1 is `"'\''abc` (we escape
    # single quotes in $1 before they're passed to `eval`) and $2 is `a`:
    #
    # First expansion (current shell):
    # `eval "$2=\"\$$2 '\$1'\""` -> `eval a="$a '$1'"` (lit.)
    #
    # Second expansion (`eval`); assuming the content of $a is `'b'`:
    # `eval a="$a '$1'"` -> `a = 'b' '"'\''abc'` (illust. of meta expansion)
    #
    # Key points:
    # - Due to the sophisticated escaping, single quotes from the first
    #   expansion carry their significance to the second expansion.
